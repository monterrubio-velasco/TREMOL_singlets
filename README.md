Overview
========

Welcome to TREMOL (sTochastic Rupture Earthquake MOdeL). This code is a sequential julia modelling tool to simulate seismic asperity rupture scenario based on the Fiber Bundle model.
This branch is developed to simulate foreshocks-mainshock sequences that occur when an asperity is included. The asperity assumption produces magnitude-frequency distributions that appart away from a typical Gutenberg-Richter relation. In this version is also possible to play with the shape of the asperity and background

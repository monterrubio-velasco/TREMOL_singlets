# veciProhiDiag.jl : Compute the number of cells that overpass the threshold load value. But also in this version it choose the cells that is ruptured because the strength criterion defined in TREMOL algorithm

#Parameters
# - `vector::Array`:vector of nine positions that contains the neighbors and failed cell, being:   vector[9], vector[3], vector[7] and vector[1] diagonal neighbors; vector[8], vector[2], vector[4] and vector[6] perpendicular neighbors.`
# - `vecEsfDiag::Float`: Load value will be transfer to the Diagonal neighbors. `

# - `B::Array`: updated vector of four positions that contains the new amount of load given to the diagonal neighbors
